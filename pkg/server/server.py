    Trade Server routes system events amongst worker components via a queue in

        3. Datahandler pushes Market Events into event queue.

        5. Strategy creates a Signal event and places it in event queque.
        6. Signal events consumed by Portfolio.
        7. Portfolio creates Order event from Signal, places it in queue.
        8. Broker executes Order events, creates Fill event post-transaction.
